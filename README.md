🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning and Streamlit
This project is an end-to-end House Price Prediction System built during my internship. It uses Multiple Linear Regression to estimate the price of a house based on various features such as area, location, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and more. The model is deployed with an interactive Streamlit UI, allowing users to easily input data and receive real-time predictions.

🚀 Features
✅ Predict house prices using a trained Multiple Regression model

✅ Clean and intuitive Streamlit web interface for user interaction

✅ Data preprocessing and feature engineering included

✅ Real-time predictions based on user input

✅ Fully reproducible and easy to understand

📌 Technologies Used
Python

Pandas & NumPy – for data manipulation

Scikit-learn – for building the regression model

Matplotlib / Seaborn – for visualizations

Streamlit – for creating the user interface
